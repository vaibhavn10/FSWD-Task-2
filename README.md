About this project:

This is a responsive and interactive web page that displays a list of products created by using React.js and styled-components. When you hover on product image its information is displayed on it and for mobile devices information is already displayed. We can sort all the products from lower to higher or higher to lower price. Along with that we have a user-friendly pagination system to navigate through the product list.
